      Taito has released several arcade sequels. The first was Space Invaders Part II in
      1979; it featured color graphics, an attract mode, new gameplay elements, and added an intermission
      between gameplay. According to the Killer List of Video Games, this was the first video game to include
      an intermission. The game also allowed the player with the top score to sign their name on the high
      score table. This version was released in the United States as Deluxe Space Invaders (also known as
      Space Invaders Deluxe), but it featured a different graphical color scheme and a lunar-city
      background.

    <p class="text-white">
      The player defeats an alien and earns points by shooting it with the laser cannon. As
      more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating all the
      aliens on-screen brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue endlessly. A
      special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if
      destroyed.<br>The aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing at it while they approach the
      bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is declared successful and the game
      ends tragically. The game will also end if all the player's cannons are destroyed by the enemies.

    <p class="text-white title">Music</p>
    <p class="text-white">
      Whereas video game music prior to Space Invaders was restricted to the extremities
      (i.e., a short introductory theme with game-over counterpart), the alien-inspired hit featured
      continuous music—the well-known four-note loop—throughout, uninterrupted by sound effects: "It was thus
      the first that sound effects and music were superimposed to form a rich sonic landscape. Not only
      do players receive feedback related directly to their actions through sound effects; they also receive
      stimulus in a more subtle, non-interactive fashion through music."
